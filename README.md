<h2>🌍 Overview</h2>

<p align = center>
The Time Tracker Console Application is a software solution designed to track time spent on various activities within a project. The application will provide a user-friendly interface that enables users to create persons and projects, insert time to a specific project, and edit persons, projects, and time. Additionally, the application will prevent the creation of insertions by id. The solution will utilize C# as the primary language and will be developed using .NET6.
